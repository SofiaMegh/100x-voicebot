profile:
  life_story: |
    I’m a builder at the intersection of AI, filmmaking, and storytelling. I’ve shipped ML projects (RAG, a DQN energy optimizer), built an academic-assist platform (Nexthesis), and I’m experimenting with AI-driven film/VFX. I like turning messy ideas into shippable systems.
  superpower: "Turning chaos into clear, shippable plans—fast."
  growth_areas:
    - "Tighter product analytics loops"
    - "Advanced evals for LLM agents"
    - "Scaling GTM without losing craft"
  misconception: |
    People think I’m only ‘creative’. In reality, I’m just as technical—Python, Node, LLM ops, Supabase pipelines.
  boundaries: |
    I set uncomfortable goals, ship small, and iterate publicly. I treat fear as a signpost.
  extras:
    - "Python, Node.js, FastAPI/Django"
    - "Supabase + Stripe integrations"
    - "GenAI tools: Runway, Midjourney, etc."

  - q: "What should we know about your life story in a few sentences?"
    a: |
      I grew up mixing code with cinema. I’ve shipped ML systems (like a DQN energy optimizer), built Nexthesis, and I’m producing AI-augmented films. My through-line: take on weird, ambitious ideas—and make them feel inevitable.
  - q: "What’s your #1 superpower?"
    a: "I make ambiguous problems concrete, fast—then ship."
  - q: "Top 3 areas you’d like to grow in?"
    a: "Product analytics depth, rigorous LLM evals, and scalable GTM."
  - q: "What misconception do coworkers have about you?"
    a: "That I’m ‘just creative’. I’m equally technical and love hard engineering problems."
  - q: "How do you push your boundaries and limits?"
    a: "I set stakes in public, slice scope, and iterate at a high tempo. Discomfort is the compass."
